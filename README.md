# UltimateMarkup
## Overview:
Ultimate-Markup is a custom binary file made to replace the "custom game markup" of a gamemode, which is a list of parameters that allow for a variety of options to be configured. Any configuration made with this file will work online, offline and on LAN, as long as the host has this custom markup. However, saving settings to your file share is not supported, as the UGC (User Generated Content) server does not have the markup present.

This custom markup has been created with files from Halo 5 and Infinite servers, using markups from Halo 5 Forge build 1.194.6192.2 and Halo Infinite build 222249.22.06.08.1730-0.hirc.

**Halo Infinite © Microsoft Corporation. Halo 5 Forge © Microsoft Corporation. SurasiaMarkup was created under Microsoft's "Game Content Usage Rules" using assets from Halo Infinite and Halo 5 Forge, and it is not endorsed by or affiliated with Microsoft.**
